Blockquotes are cool and are used with a less than sign

Inline code are used with the hyphon 
Inline code
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

Syntax highlighting is really nifty for identifying and highlighting code segments done with three hyphons
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

Indending code is always a good idea. 

    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
    
Task lists are really neat because they can help when making and working on github issues.

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
If you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will get a handy progress indicator in your issue list. It also works in Pull Requests!

Tables are a great way to organize information. Not the simplest to memorize, it uses the pipe key to divide columns and the minus key to identity horizontal lines.
